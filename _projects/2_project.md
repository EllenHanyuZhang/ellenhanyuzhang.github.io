---

• Independently designed the mathematical model and implemented the simulation of scale-free multi-dimensional simplicial complex networks using object-oriented programming in Python

• Led a team of 2 to conduct degree distribution and robustness analysis of the multi-dimensional network using log-log fit, Hill estimator, and homology measures

• Runner-Up in the Applied Sciences category of the 2022 Spring Symposium held by Cornell Undergrad Research Board
