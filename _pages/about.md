Hi! I am a Master's student at Cornell University, concentrating in Financial Engineering. Prior to graduate school, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Operations Research and Information Engineering from Cornell in 2022. I also spent a semester at Tsinghua University as an exchange student in Fall 2020. 

I look forward to pursuing a future career in quantitative finance. After spending a summer as a Sales & Trading analyst at Citibank Shanghai, I'm grateful to be returning to Citi's NYC office as a quantitative analyst over the upcoming summer. 

When I'm not busy with projects or schoolwork, catch me in squash courts, KTVs or language corners! I never skipped class to travel XD
